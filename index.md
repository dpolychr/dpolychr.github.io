### About

I'm a molecular biologist ([BSc, Democritus University of Thrace](http://www.mbg.duth.gr/)) once worked as an experimentalist ([yeast times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661920)) and who is now interested in computational genomics ([MSc & PhD in Bioinformatics, University of Athens](http://www.demokritos.gr/?lang=en)). 
I currently work as a Data Scientist for [Genomics England] (https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/) within the [100 K Genomes project] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000_Genomes_Project). I am also a visiting scientist at [Boris Lenhard's group] (https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/research-group/computational-regulatory-genomics/) at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences & Imperial College London.
