### About

I come from beautiful Greece. Born and raised in Gerakas, Athens, I always feel nostalgic when I visit my village Figaleia and the nearby temple of Apollo Epicurius in Peloponnese. 

I'm a molecular biologist ([BSc, Democritus University of Thrace](http://www.mbg.duth.gr/)) once trained as an experimentalist ([yeast times...](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661920)) and who has since then been interested in bioinformatics and computational genomics ([MSc and PhD in Bioinformatics, University of Athens & NCSR "Demokritos"](http://www.demokritos.gr/?lang=en)). I currently work as a Data Scientist for [Genomics England](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/), a company set up by the UK Department of Health to deliver the [100 K Genomes project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000_Genomes_Project). This transformative project has resulted in bringing the power of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) into routine healthcare in the NHS. Prior to that, I spent two lovely years as an MRC Postdoctoral (and now visiting) scientist at [Boris Lenhard's group](https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/research-group/computational-regulatory-genomics/) at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences & Imperial College London working on a largely enigmatic class of genomic elements called [Conserved Non-coding Elements (CNEs)](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkx1074/4599184). I am also a visiting scientist at the [NCSR Demokritos](http://www.demokritos.gr/?lang=en) where I participate in the [BioASQ project](http://bioasq.org/).

You can find an interview by [Lifebit](https://lifebit.ai/) providing a very general and brief overview of the work we are doing at Genomics England [here](https://blog.lifebit.ai/2018/11/28/on-the-frontlines-of-rare-disease-diagnosis-dr-dimitris-polychronopoulos-and-dr-kristina-ibanez-garikano-genomics-england/)
