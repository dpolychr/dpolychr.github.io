### About

I come from beautiful and sunny Greece. I'm a molecular biologist ([BSc, Democritus University of Thrace](http://www.mbg.duth.gr/)) once trained as an experimentalist ([yeast times...](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661920)) and who has since then been interested in computational genomics ([MSc and PhD in Bioinformatics, University of Athens](http://www.demokritos.gr/?lang=en)). I currently work as a Data Scientist for [Genomics England](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/) within the [100 K Genomes project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000_Genomes_Project). Prior to that, I was an MRC Postdoctoral scientist (and now visiting scientist) at [Boris Lenhard's group](https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/research-group/computational-regulatory-genomics/) at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences & Imperial College London working on the mystery of Conserved Non-coding Elements.
